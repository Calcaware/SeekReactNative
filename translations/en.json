    "june_description": "Every species in a coral reef is important to the rest of the wildlife community, whether it is food for other creatures or a predator that keeps other populations under control. Food chains can be delicate and complex, and this is the case in every ecosystem on our planet. Seek out different levels in your local web of life, and learn how each one enables other species to survive.",
    "november_description": "Humans have always depended on trees and forests for survival. They give us clean air, food, shelter and wood. They take in carbon from the air and lock it away in their wood or the soil. Spending time among trees makes us feel better in mind and body. We need them now even more than ever, and so do a huge number of other living things. Seek out the trees in your local area and feel the benefits for yourself!",
    "august_description": "Big animals of the grassland plains are losing their habitat to farmland, but they are not the only wildlife affected by our food production. Insects populations are declining around our planet, partly because crops replace their habitats and are then sprayed with bug-killing pesticides. We need insect pollinators for our crops and wild plants to flourish, and many amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals depend on insects for food. Seek out the insects around you and show them some love!",
    "september_description": "Freshwater is essential for all life on land, and freshwater habitats are home to more than 10 per cent of all known animals and almost half of all known fish species. Rivers, streams and lakes allow wildlife to travel vast distances to complete their life cycles. Seek out ponds, streams, rivers and lakes in your area and see what freshwater species you can spot.",
    "october_description": "The seas cover vast areas of our planet, and without modern technology humans would find it very difficult to cross these huge expanses. Many bird species, however, do exactly this every year. Millions of birds migrate from one country to another to escape cold weather and to find food. Keeping track of when wildlife migrates can help us understand how climate change is affecting the natural world. Seek birds visiting your local area and find out where else they spend their time.",
    "december_description": "Climate change is not just affecting the frozen worlds at our planet’s poles. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns can cause species to move out of habitats that become uncomfortable and into areas that couldn’t support them before. It can also mean that changes linked to seasons (known as ‘phenology’) such as leaf fall, bud burst and flowering start to take place at different times. This may cause problems for other species that are hard to predict. Seek out your local plant life and see how your local environment may be changing.",
